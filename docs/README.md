## Welcome to the Cod-O`Complete project!

The goal of this project is to present a set of articles with associated examples on the problem of code autocompletion with deep learning. 

### Why code auto-completion?

Because it's easy! (almost)

Deep learning for natural language has made huge progress over the last few years. It's pretty easy to train a neural net on a text corpus to teach it to replicate the style through new content generation. That's a good start for code completion has it contains a lot of structure and for the semantic content, the developer is there to take all required decisions. 

Also, with all the code available in open source, huge datasets are already available in a clean format (as they can be compiled). Additionally, compilers can help to put labels and symbol linking to any of the code tokens. 

This last point will be extremely useful to build a syntaxic tree representation of java files and then build datasets from well-choosen part of the trees. 

### Articles
More articles will be added over time :) (hopefully).
